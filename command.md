# can you create any asm for pokemon fire red that enables the rival to be based on gender just like pokemon emerald? like if i chooes red, i get leaf as rival and vice-versa?

Yes! In PokÃ©mon FireRed, the rival is always the opposite of the player's chosen name rather than gender. However, in PokÃ©mon Emerald, the rival changes based on gender (Brendan/May).

I'll provide an ASM hack for FireRed that:

Checks the player's gender.
Sets the rival to Leaf if the player is Red (Male).
Sets the rival to Red if the player is Leaf (Female).
ASM Code:
```
.thumb
.syntax unified
.global set_rival_gender
set_rival_gender:
    push {r0-r2, lr}        @ Save registers
    ldr r0, =0x020370A8     @ Load player gender memory address
    ldrb r0, [r0]           @ Read gender (0 = Male, 1 = Female)
    cmp r0, #0              @ Check if Male
    beq set_rival_leaf      @ If Male, set Rival as Leaf
    b set_rival_red         @ If Female, set Rival as Red

set_rival_leaf:
    ldr r1, =0x020399A4     @ Rival name memory address
    ldr r2, =leaf_name      @ Load "Leaf" name pointer
    b copy_name             @ Copy name and return

set_rival_red:
    ldr r1, =0x020399A4     @ Rival name memory address
    ldr r2, =red_name       @ Load "Red" name pointer

copy_name:
    movs r3, #5             @ Name length (5 characters)
copy_loop:
    ldrb r0, [r2], #1       @ Load character from source name
    strb r0, [r1], #1       @ Store it in rival's name memory
    subs r3, #1             @ Decrement counter
    bne copy_loop           @ Repeat until name is copied
    pop {r0-r2, lr}         @ Restore registers
    bx lr                   @ Return to game

.align 4
leaf_name: .asciz "LEAF"
red_name:  .asciz "RED"
```


# How It Works:
Reads Player Gender
0x020370A8 stores gender (0 = Male, 1 = Female).
Changes Rival Name
If Male â†’ Rival is Leaf.
If Female â†’ Rival is Red.
Stores Rival Name in Memory
Rivalâ€™s name is stored at 0x020399A4.
Copies the correct name (LEAF or RED) into memory.
# How to Apply This Hack:
Assemble the Code:
Use ARMIPS or a Thumb assembler.
Inject Into FireRed ROM:
Hook it into the rival naming function (0x0806F7D0 in FireRed).
Modify the routine to call set_rival_gender instead of manually setting the name.
# Things to Consider:
This only changes the rivalâ€™s name, not their sprite or dialogue.
If you want a full gender-based rival swap (with sprites and text changes), you'll need to modify:
Trainer sprites (0x08xxxxx in ROM).
Trainer data (trainer data table).
Text scripts (event scripting in XSE or PKSV).
Would you like help expanding this to include sprite changes too? ðŸš€


# Hook it into the rival naming function (0x0806F7D0 in FireRed) and
Modify the routine to call set_rival_gender instead of manually setting the name.

To hook into the rival naming function at 0x0806F7D0 in PokÃ©mon FireRed, we'll modify the routine to call our custom set_rival_gender function.

Steps:
Find the Rival Naming Routine
At 0x0806F7D0, the game normally handles setting the rival's name.
Inject a Hook to Call Our Function
Replace the original instruction with a BL (Branch Link) to our new function.
Modify the ROM Using an Assembler
Weâ€™ll use ARMIPS or a hex editor for patching.
Final Hooked ASM Code:

```
.thumb
.syntax unified
.org 0x0806F7D0           @ Hook into the rival naming function
    bl set_rival_gender   @ Call our function
    bx lr                 @ Return

.org 0x080xxxxx           @ Place our custom function in free space
set_rival_gender:
    push {r0-r2, lr}      @ Save registers

    ldr r0, =0x020370A8   @ Load player gender address
    ldrb r0, [r0]         @ Read gender (0 = Male, 1 = Female)

    cmp r0, #0            @ Check if Male
    beq set_rival_leaf    @ If Male, set Rival as Leaf
    b set_rival_red       @ If Female, set Rival as Red

set_rival_leaf:
    ldr r1, =0x020399A4   @ Rival name memory
    ldr r2, =leaf_name    @ Load "Leaf" name pointer
    b copy_name           @ Copy name and return

set_rival_red:
    ldr r1, =0x020399A4   @ Rival name memory
    ldr r2, =red_name     @ Load "Red" name pointer

copy_name:
    movs r3, #5           @ Name length (5 characters)
copy_loop:
    ldrb r0, [r2], #1     @ Load character from source name
    strb r0, [r1], #1     @ Store it in rival's name memory
    subs r3, #1           @ Decrement counter
    bne copy_loop         @ Repeat until name is copied

    pop {r0-r2, lr}       @ Restore registers
    bx lr                 @ Return to original function

.align 4
leaf_name: .asciz "LEAF"
red_name:  .asciz "RED"
```
How to Apply This Patch:
Assemble Using ARMIPS
Save the code as rival_fix.asm
Use ARMIPS to patch:
arduino
Copy
Edit
armips rival_fix.asm -symbols
Alternatively, Patch Using a Hex Editor
Locate 0x0806F7D0 in a FireRed ROM.
Replace the function call with a branch to your free space location (e.g., 0x080xxxxx).
Test in an Emulator
Use mGBA or VisualBoyAdvance-M to debug.
Expected Behavior:
If Male (Red) â†’ Rival is Leaf
If Female (Leaf) â†’ Rival is Red
Works automatically without modifying the game's default name input screen.
Let me know if you need help expanding this to change sprites or dialogues too! ðŸš€
