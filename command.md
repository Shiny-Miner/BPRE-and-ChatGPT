# can you create any asm for pokemon fire red that enables the rival to be based on gender just like pokemon emerald? like if i chooes red, i get leaf as rival and vice-versa?

Yes! In PokÃ©mon FireRed, the rival is always the opposite of the player's chosen name rather than gender. However, in PokÃ©mon Emerald, the rival changes based on gender (Brendan/May).

I'll provide an ASM hack for FireRed that:

Checks the player's gender.
Sets the rival to Leaf if the player is Red (Male).
Sets the rival to Red if the player is Leaf (Female).
ASM Code:

.thumb
.syntax unified
.global set_rival_gender
set_rival_gender:
    push {r0-r2, lr}        @ Save registers

    ldr r0, =0x020370A8     @ Load player gender memory address
    ldrb r0, [r0]           @ Read gender (0 = Male, 1 = Female)

    cmp r0, #0              @ Check if Male
    beq set_rival_leaf      @ If Male, set Rival as Leaf
    b set_rival_red         @ If Female, set Rival as Red

set_rival_leaf:
    ldr r1, =0x020399A4     @ Rival name memory address
    ldr r2, =leaf_name      @ Load "Leaf" name pointer
    b copy_name             @ Copy name and return

set_rival_red:
    ldr r1, =0x020399A4     @ Rival name memory address
    ldr r2, =red_name       @ Load "Red" name pointer

copy_name:
    movs r3, #5             @ Name length (5 characters)
copy_loop:
    ldrb r0, [r2], #1       @ Load character from source name
    strb r0, [r1], #1       @ Store it in rival's name memory
    subs r3, #1             @ Decrement counter
    bne copy_loop           @ Repeat until name is copied

    pop {r0-r2, lr}         @ Restore registers
    bx lr                   @ Return to game

.align 4
leaf_name: .asciz "LEAF"
red_name:  .asciz "RED"


# How It Works:
Reads Player Gender
0x020370A8 stores gender (0 = Male, 1 = Female).
Changes Rival Name
If Male â†’ Rival is Leaf.
If Female â†’ Rival is Red.
Stores Rival Name in Memory
Rivalâ€™s name is stored at 0x020399A4.
Copies the correct name (LEAF or RED) into memory.
# How to Apply This Hack:
Assemble the Code:
Use ARMIPS or a Thumb assembler.
Inject Into FireRed ROM:
Hook it into the rival naming function (0x0806F7D0 in FireRed).
Modify the routine to call set_rival_gender instead of manually setting the name.
# Things to Consider:
This only changes the rivalâ€™s name, not their sprite or dialogue.
If you want a full gender-based rival swap (with sprites and text changes), you'll need to modify:
Trainer sprites (0x08xxxxx in ROM).
Trainer data (trainer data table).
Text scripts (event scripting in XSE or PKSV).
Would you like help expanding this to include sprite changes too? ðŸš€
