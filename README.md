# BPRE-and-ChatGPT

Creating a C injection to implement Wonder Trades in Pokémon Fire Red is a complex task involving several steps, including reverse engineering, ROM hacking, and writing custom code. Below is a more detailed guide with some code snippets to help you get started. Note that this is a hypothetical example and may not work directly without significant additional work and understanding of GBA development.

Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment
Install DevKitARM: This is a part of the devkitPro toolchain used for GBA development.
sh
Copy code
sudo dkp-pacman -S devkitARM
Set Up Your Project Structure:
sh
Copy code
mkdir gba-wondertrade
cd gba-wondertrade
mkdir src include
Step 2: Write the Injection Code
File: include/wonder_trade.h

c
Copy code
#ifndef WONDER_TRADE_H
#define WONDER_TRADE_H

typedef struct {
    char name[10];
    int level;
    int hp;
    // Other stats and data...
} Pokemon;

void wonder_trade(Pokemon* player_pokemon);

#endif // WONDER_TRADE_H
File: src/wonder_trade.c

c
Copy code
#include "wonder_trade.h"
#include <string.h>

// Hypothetical functions for network communication
void init_network() {
    // Initialize network hardware (stub function)
}

int send_data(void* data, int size) {
    // Send data over the network (stub function)
    return 0;
}

int receive_data(void* buffer, int size) {
    // Receive data from the network (stub function)
    return 0;
}

void wonder_trade(Pokemon* player_pokemon) {
    init_network();

    // Send player's Pokémon
    send_data(player_pokemon, sizeof(Pokemon));

    // Receive a random Pokémon in return
    Pokemon traded_pokemon;
    receive_data(&traded_pokemon, sizeof(Pokemon));

    // Copy traded Pokémon to player's party
    memcpy(player_pokemon, &traded_pokemon, sizeof(Pokemon));
}
Step 3: Inject the Code into the ROM
To inject the code into the ROM, you need to:

Disassemble the ROM: Use a tool like IDA Pro or Ghidra to locate the functions you need to hook.
Find a Suitable Location: Locate free space in the ROM where you can place your new code.
Write Hook Code: Modify the ROM to call your new wonder_trade function at the appropriate place.
Example Hook Code in Assembly (Hypothetical)

assembly
Copy code
.thumb
.global original_trade_function
.thumb_func

original_trade_function:
    ldr r0, =0x02024000     @ Address of player's Pokémon in memory (hypothetical)
    bl wonder_trade         @ Call the new wonder_trade function
    b original_trade_function_continue  @ Continue with original trade logic

.original_trade_function_continue:
    @ Rest of the original trade function...
Linker Script
Create a linker script to place your new code at the correct memory location.

File: gba_wondertrade.ld

ld
Copy code
SECTIONS
{
    .text 0x08000000 : {
        *(.text*)
    }
    .wonder_trade 0x080E0000 : {
        *(.wonder_trade)
    }
}
Step 4: Compile and Link the Code
Write a Makefile:
File: Makefile

makefile
Copy code
CC = arm-none-eabi-gcc
LD = arm-none-eabi-ld
CFLAGS = -mthumb -mthumb-interwork -mlong-calls -Iinclude
LDFLAGS = -T gba_wondertrade.ld

SRC = src/wonder_trade.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)

all: wonder_trade.gba

wonder_trade.gba: $(OBJ)
    $(LD) $(LDFLAGS) -o wonder_trade.gba $(OBJ)

clean:
    rm -f $(OBJ) wonder_trade.gba
Compile the Code:
sh
Copy code
make
Step 5: Patch the ROM
Use a tool like ARMIPS or Binary Ninja to patch the compiled binary into the ROM at the appropriate location.

Example Patch Script for ARMIPS:

assembly
Copy code
.org 0x080E0000
.incbin "wonder_trade.gba"
Patching:

sh
Copy code
armips patch_script.asm
Step 6: Test the ROM
Run the patched ROM in an emulator like VisualBoyAdvance or on real hardware using a flash cartridge.

# Making items with pokeemerald
make a graphic in graphics gale or another art program, (someone recommend the other good program can't remember the name esprite?)
define the graphic,  add the item constant  add template value to the items list.  (to fill in when you complete the effects/know what  everything should be)

From here the process differs based on what kind of item you want to make,
but the simple explanation is it depends on if you're making a held item,
a battle item, or key item, and if said item is allowed to be used from the overworld.

typically if its not a key item and can be used outside of battle,
you need to make an item effect for it in the item effect table.

Decide the hold effect, should it have one.
Either use an existing effect from the hold effect table or make a new effect
tldr, you don't necessarily  need to make a "new effect" for it to have a unique effect.
.holdEffect = HOLD_EFFECT_ELECTRIC_POWER,
.holdEffectParam =  20,

as they are a function of the effect itself and the parameter value.



for an example of how to setup
I'd recommend searching ITEM_RARE_CANDY in the repo.

if you need more than that, just keep searching similar items till you find everything.
